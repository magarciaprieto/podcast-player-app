# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Getting Started

To get started with podcast-player-app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Checking type / ESlint errors

To run TypeScript and ESLint checks:

```bash
npm run type
```

## Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

This command will serve the application from the dist folder on the default port: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

In case the previous commands failed, please install http-server globally:
